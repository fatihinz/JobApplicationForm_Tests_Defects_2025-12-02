Stronger data model for name & identity

    Support international names properly

        Allow Unicode letters, spaces, hyphens, apostrophes; do not restrict to A‑Z only, to avoid blocking real names from different locales.

​

Keep clear max length (e.g. 100–150 chars) and trim leading/trailing spaces server‑side rather than over‑validating on the client.

    ​

Simplify structure while keeping mapping options

    Use a single required Full name field for the user, then (optionally) derive or request First/Last only if an ATS or HR system truly requires them.

​

If First/Last must exist, document rules (Latin‑only vs any script) and keep validation consistent across frontend and backend.

    ​

Add semantic and autocomplete hints

    Use proper label + for attributes and autocomplete="name", given-name, family-name for better UX and accessibility.

        ​

Accessibility and keyboard UX

    Make the form fully keyboard‑operable

        Fix tab order so every field and radio group is reachable via Tab; use arrow keys within radio groups, as per WCAG 2.1 guidance.

​
Ensure visible focus styles (outline) for all interactive elements and sufficient color contrast for labels, errors, and buttons.

Responsive layout & device strategy

    Define and test clear breakpoints

        Mobile: up to ~576 px – one‑column layout, big tap targets, no horizontal scroll.

        Tablet: 577–1024 px – mainly one column with a few two‑column rows (name, phone).

        Desktop: 1025–1440+ px – two‑column layout within a max‑width container (~960–1200 px) to avoid ultra‑wide lines.

    ​

Align controls with device capabilities

    Use appropriate HTML input types: type="email", type="tel", type="url", type="date" so mobile keyboards match the field type.

​

Test on at least 375 px, 768 px, 1024 px, 1366/1440 px to cover common phones, tablets, laptops.

     Risk‑based & quality‑of‑life improvements

    Prioritise tests and monitoring by risk

        Treat submission, CV upload, contact details, and consent/CAPTCHA as P1 flows; optional fields and styling as P2+.

​

Add lightweight analytics on drop‑offs (e.g., users abandoning on CV upload or validation errors) to feed back into UX changes.

    ​

Harden security and robustness

    Validate all input server‑side as well (email, phone, URLs, file type/size) and escape text to prevent XSS.

​

Set sensible rate limits on submissions and ensure CAPTCHA / backend errors produce user‑friendly messages, not generic 500s.  ​
